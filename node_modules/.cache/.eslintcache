The authors decided to use simple line\n                graphs as data visualizations for temperature, light level,\n                humidity, barometric pressure and movement (accelerometer\n                values).

The findings show how participants\n                reconstruct behavior, both individually and collectively, expose\n                the sensitive personal data of others, and use sensor data as\n                evidence and for lateral surveillance within the household.\n                <br />\n                Visualized sensor data used as evidence and proof: Participants\n                used visualized data to confirm their assumptions about other\n                residents’ behavior, not only retrospectively during discussions\n                but also pro-actively during data collection when they had\n                access to it. For example, a participant corrected the partner’s\n                careless behavior regarding the light in the hallway (figure 3),\n                which he often forgot to turn off.

The geo-localised\n                measures and user-generated meta-data can be automatically sent\n                and shared online with the public to contribute to the\n                collective noise mapping of cities. The prototype called Noise\n                Tube can be found online. This application collects local\n                information from different sensors (noise level, GPS\n                coordinates, time, user input) and sends them to the NoiseTube\n                server which visualizes the noise level data. The server\n                centralises and processes the data sent by the phones.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                The mobile application contains a real-time signal processing\n                algorithm which measures the loudness level of the microphone\n                recording the environmental sound (at 22500 Hz, 16 bits) over 1\n                second at a chosen interval. On top of the sensing of the\n                loudness a real time visualization is displayed on the phone\n                with the decibels. To add meaning to this value it is associated\n                with a colour that represents the health risk of the current\n                exposure level: less than 70: green (no risk); between 70 and\n                80: yellow (be careful); more than 80: red (risky). See figure 2\n                below.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                <img src={lit2} alt=\"poster gif\" className=\"vis-img\" />\n                <br />\n                In addition to measured loudness, the app allows to record the\n                source or context of noise, which is not always available but\n                remains important. Especially because the appreciation of sound\n                and loudness is a subjective matter – i.e. the perceived\n                annoyance (or pleasure) does not always correlate with its\n                loudness (see 6.2). Context is recorded through environmental\n                tagging (source of a noise e.g.: cars, aircraft, neighbours and\n                an annoyance rating/tag) and geo-tagging (gps positioning or\n                place tags (such as “home”, “work”, the name of the subway\n                station, ...) Geo-tagging feature we can reconstruct the\n                geo-coordinates afterwards notably for indoor locations (cf.\n                subway noise map in figure 3).\n                <br />\n                <img src={lit3} alt=\"poster gif\" className=\"vis-img\" />\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                Visualizing Noise Maps. Once the measured data is sent to the\n                server, any user can see his own contributions or exposures by\n                going to the NoiseTube website and visualizing them on a map\n                thanks to Google Earth. The collective noise map is also\n                publicly available constructed by aggregating all the shared\n                participants. Each map can show a layer of participants to add\n                context and meaning to the loudness data.

They also\n                present tinyLAB, a Matlab-based tool developed in the context of\n                this work, which enables real-time acquisition, processing and\n                visualization of data collected in wireless sensor networks.\n                Authors mention that prototyping wireless sensor network\n                applications often requires visualizing the sensor data to\n                quickly identify any malfunctioning. For example, figure 1 shows\n                the responses to these acoustic events of four different nodes,\n                clearly pointing out a misalignment in the measured equivalent\n                noise levels. <br />\n                <br />\n                <img src={lit4} alt=\"poster gif\" className=\"vis-img\" />\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                Additionally, authors mention that current tools often do not\n                provide satisfactory data processing and visualization features\n                and propose using Matlab as it serves scientists in managing,\n                processing and visualizing their data and appears therefore\n                particularly well-suited to be used in the context of wireless\n                sensor networks. Authors develop tinyLAB, a simple framework\n                that allows to receive and send messages from and to a sensor\n                network and to visualize and process data as it comes from the\n                network. tinyLAB is implemented relying solely on the Matlab\n                software suite and offers a simple API to receive and send data.\n              </p>\n            </Collapsible>\n            <br />\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <p className=\"full-text\">\n              <br />\n              <b>\n                Ann-sofie Gunnarsson, Malinda Rauhala, Anders Henrysson, and\n                Anders Ynnerman. 2006.

Data collected from an embedded wireless sensor matrix\n                is used to synthesize AR visualizations in real-time. The AR\n                visualization is providing the user with an instant insight\n                concerning the status of the element being augmented. The\n                authors arrange sensors in a grid (e.g. a matrix), which allows\n                to take an approach where individual sensors emerge as pixels in\n                an image when their data is translated into color values. See\n                below an image that shows a mobile application overview.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                <img src={lit5} alt=\"poster gif\" className=\"vis-img\" />\n                <br /> <br />\n                Authors argue that AR is an ideal way to present such context\n                related visualizations since it eliminates the focus switching\n                between the visualization domain (image) and problem domain\n                (real world). The sensors measure the relative humidity (RH) at\n                the location of the sensor, providing with data from a discrete\n                set of measure points in 3D. The values between the measure\n                points are interpolated creating a continuous visualization\n                which provides the user an overview of the humidity values as\n                well as their distribution. The mobile phone application\n                contains a visualization engine and a communication layer. The\n                interpolation is performed in real time and every time a new\n                sensor value is retrieved from the sensor network the\n                visualization is updated. Two visualization options are\n                implemented, one fully continuous, see Figure below, while the\n                other is composed of small quadratic units, separated using full\n                transparency. Authors believe that the user experiences a better\n                sense of orientation when less background information is covered\n                by the visualization.\n                <br />\n              </p>\n            </Collapsible>\n            <br />\n          </div>\n\n          <div>\n            <p className=\"full-text\">\n              <br />\n              <b>\n                Sapan Tanted, Anshul Agarwal, Shinjan Mitra, Chaitra Bahuman,\n                and Krithi Ramamritham. 2020.

Authors advise against displaying too many data points on\n                a single screen as it can make the visualization slow, increase\n                network usage and render the interface less informative and\n                cluttered. They note that techniques like filtering, sampling\n                and aggregation are commonly used in visualization systems to\n                reduce the number of data points displayed. Authors state that\n                the existing visualization systems are found to be inadequate in\n                handling the inflow of large volumes of data. They propose a\n                system that combines aggregation and caching techniques to\n                implement a robust solution that helps visualization of large\n                amounts of sensor data. Authors used Grafana as a visualization\n                interface for their experiments since it is a widelyused\n                open-source tool, provides data customization and allows\n                creating dashboards with attractive visualizations. The\n                technique proposed in this paper follows a hybrid approach where\n                aggregation is performed on-demand, and aggregation of future\n                requests is also taken into consideration. Thus, it requires\n                less space for storing the aggregated data, with minimal delays\n                experienced by users. The proposed approach is independent of\n                the visualization tool and databases and integrates well with\n                existing systems. <br />\n                <br />\n                <img src={lit1a} alt=\"poster gif\" className=\"vis-img\" />\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                One sample visualization from the project is the comparison\n                between the power consumption of two labs - as visualizing raw\n                data for one year is not possible, the system aggregates and\n                visualizes the data as shown in Figure 5, which shows the power\n                consumption of appliances (lights and fans) of two labs (lab1 -\n                green, lab2 - orange) in the building for a period of one month.\n                The user can zoom in to the desired section to view lower\n                granularity data, based on the visual inspection of this graph.\n                The visualization interface enables a smooth transition between\n                granularities to provide rich user experience as shown in Figure\n                6.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                <img src={granular} alt=\"poster gif\" className=\"vis-img\" />\n              </p>\n            </Collapsible>\n            <br />\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <Collapsible\n              trigger=\"View more Data Visualization Research paper reviews \"\n              className=\"full-text\"\n            >\n              {' '}\n              <div>\n                <p className=\"full-text\">\n                  <br />\n                  <b>\n                    Ivan Logre, Sébastien Mosser, and Michel Riveill. 2015.\n                    Composition challenges for sensor data visualization.\n                  </b>\n                  <br />\n                  In{' '}\n                  <i>\n                    Companion Proceedings of the 14th International Conference\n                    on Modularity\n                  </i>{' '}\n                  (<i>MODULARITY Companion 2015</i>).

In particular, the\n                    authors argue that unfortunately, the tools available to\n                    design and implement such dashboards are holistic and do not\n                    take into account the inherent modularity of this domain.\n                    Authors mention that the design and implementation of a\n                    visualization dashboard involves three roles: 1. a\n                    Requirement Engineer (RE); 2. a Data Manager (DM); 3. a\n                    Dashboard Designer (DD). <br />\n                    <br />\n                    According to the authors, to implement a given dashboard,\n                    one can usually use visualization widget libraries, either\n                    professional solutions such as HighChart1 and AmChart2 or\n                    community-based libraries such as D3.JS3 . Then, one will\n                    add HTML5/CSS code to structure the result. However, those\n                    widgets do not allow their integration with a lot of data\n                    format, since the development effort is put on the\n                    interaction aspect instead of the interoperability. In\n                    addition, the huge amount of available widgets (e.g., D3.js\n                    offers 235 widgets on January 2015) increase the difficulty\n                    to select a suitable visualization. There is a lack of\n                    effort in the categorization of those new visualization\n                    capabilities. According to the authors, these last two\n                    points strengthen the difficulty to cooperate with other\n                    domains, considering the gap between the conceptual role of\n                    the RE and the implementation role of the DD, and because of\n                    the incompatible constraints imposed by the chosen libraries\n                    on data format then reduce reusability. <br />\n                    This paper does not aim to describe a solution, but instead\n                    focuses on the challenges triggered by the design of\n                    visualization dashboards, and align them with modular\n                    paradigms such as separation of concerns and software\n                    composition.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    <img src={granular} alt=\"poster gif\" className=\"vis-img\" />\n                  </p>\n                </Collapsible>\n                <br />\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <p className=\"full-text\">\n                  <br />\n                  <b>\n                    Felix G.
