We believe the best way to effectively\n            assess air pollution in urban NYC neighborhoods is to monitor at the\n            residential level, involving communities impacted by air pollution\n            in data collection, as well as data visualization. Thus, our\n            non-scientific audience will be to appreciate the implications of\n            the data.\n          </p>\n          <h4 className=\"gif-text\">\n            {' '}\n            Air Pollution and Particulate Matter (PM)\n          </h4>\n          <p className=\"full-text\">\n            {' '}\n            Air pollution poses significant health risks to urban populations,\n            notably for the elderly, immigrants, and people of color. Many\n            residents of New York City fall into one or more of these\n            categories, placing them at higher risk for air pollution-related\n            medical issues.\n            <figure>\n              <img src={airq} alt=\"air1\" className=\"gif-img\" />\n              <figlabel>\n                Size comparison for PM particles at\n                https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/images/1869-size-comparisons-for-pm-particles\n              </figlabel>\n            </figure>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Particulate Matter is all particles ≤ a certain diameter (in μm)\n            within the air, varying in size, composition, and origin; many are\n            hazardous.

Machine learning models show that using the impact of\n            noise pollution as a feature improves accuracy of air pollution\n            level predictions. In contrast with air pollution, noise pollution\n            continues to increase in developed countries and, yet, there are\n            rarely strict limits for community noise levels.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n        </div>\n        <br /> <br />\n        <div className=\"block\">\n          <h4 className=\"gif-text\">Why Noise? </h4>\n          <p className=\"full-text\">\n            Noise pollution is one of the topmost quality of life issues for\n            urban residents in the United States. It has been estimated that 9\n            out of 10 adults in New York City (NYC) are exposed to excessive\n            noise levels, i.e. beyond the limit of what the EPA considers to be\n            harmful. When applied to U.S. cities of more than 4 million\n            inhabitants, such estimates extend to over 72 million urban\n            residents. The objectives of SONYC are to create technological\n            solutions for: (1) the systematic, constant monitoring of noise\n            pollution at city scale; (2) the accurate description of acoustic\n            environments in terms of its composing sources; (3) broadening\n            citizen participation in noise reporting and mitigation; and (4)\n            enabling city agencies to take effective, information-driven action\n            for noise mitigation.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n        </div>\n        <br /> <br />\n        <br />\n      </div>\n      <Footer />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default AboutUgsrp\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
